# Log File Truncation and Security Script

## Description

This Bash script is designed to find the longest log file with a ".log" extension on the system, truncate it to the first 100 lines, change its ownership to root:root, and set its permissions to 600. This can be useful for reviewing and securing large log files on a Linux system.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.

3. Make the script executable
     ./
